Abstract

This study proposes a covenantal-continuity model for interpreting the emergence of Christianity within Second Temple Judaism. It argues that the universal horizon often associated with Christianity was already embedded within the Abrahamic and Sinaitic covenantal framework. The appearance of Jesus is therefore examined not as a rupture or replacement of Israel’s covenant, but as a historical inflection point in which a pre-existing universal trajectory became visible within broader world history. This model seeks to avoid supersessionism while preserving the irrevocability of Israel’s covenant.

1. Methodological Position

This project does not argue for:

Supersessionism

Replacement theology

Covenant annulment

Dispensational discontinuity

Instead, it operates within a Covenantal Continuity Model, defined by:

The irrevocability of Israel’s covenant (cf. Romans 11:29).

The integrity and completeness of Torah within Jewish self-understanding.

The recognition of universal motifs already present in the Hebrew Scriptures.

The interpretation of Jesus as a historical activation rather than theological replacement.

The central analytical distinction employed here is not rupture, but visibility.

2. Universal Trajectory within the Hebrew Bible

The Abrahamic covenant contains explicit universal language:

Genesis 12:3

Genesis 18:18

Genesis 22:18

The “kingdom of priests” motif (Exod 19:6) presupposes relational mediation rather than isolation.

Isaiah’s “light to the nations” passages (Isa 42:6; 49:6; 56:6–7) further articulate a vision in which Israel’s election has global implications.

These themes have been widely discussed in biblical scholarship, including:

Christopher J. H. Wright, The Mission of God

N. T. Wright, Paul and the Faithfulness of God

The argument advanced here is not that Christianity invented universality, but that Christianity operated within an already present universal horizon.

3. Paul and the Question of Boundary Formation

Recent Pauline scholarship has increasingly resisted older “law vs. grace” rupture models.

Key contributions include:

E. P. Sanders — Covenantal Nomism

James D. G. Dunn — New Perspective on Paul

N. T. Wright — Covenant Faithfulness

Within this scholarly trajectory, Paul is often understood not as abandoning Judaism, but as reconfiguring Gentile inclusion within Israel’s covenantal narrative.

This study aligns with that interpretive shift.

Paul’s experience is read not as Torah negation, but as recognition of covenantal expansion in historical form.

4. Logos Theology and Jewish Background

The Johannine Logos (John 1:1) must be situated within:

Jewish Wisdom traditions (Proverbs 8)

Targumic Memra theology

Philo of Alexandria’s Logos concept

Thus, Logos language need not imply ontological division within the Godhead.

This project prefers a layer-of-revelation model, in which Logos is understood as divine self-expression rather than a second metaphysical entity.

John 8:58 (“Before Abraham was, I am”) is therefore interpreted as a statement of ontological dimension rather than mere temporal pre-existence.

5. Greek Metaphysics and Doctrinal Formation

Post-apostolic theological articulation increasingly relied on Greek philosophical terminology.

The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) introduced formal usage of terms such as:

Ousia (essence)

Hypostasis (person/subsistence)

These developments sought doctrinal clarity and defense.

However, the present study distinguishes between:

Revelation (historical event)

Metaphysical explanation (conceptual framework)

The argument does not attack Trinitarian doctrine.
It questions whether later metaphysical formulations may obscure the covenantal continuity present in earlier proclamation.

6. Compressed Thesis

Jesus is not interpreted here as the founder of a new religion external to Judaism.

Rather, he may be understood as:

A historical inflection point in which a universal trajectory already embedded in Torah became visible within global history.

This is neither rupture nor replacement,
but covenantal continuity expressed through historical manifestation.

Concluding Clarification

This model maintains:

The dignity and endurance of Israel.

The irrevocability of covenant.

The internal coherence of Torah.

The possibility of historical inflection without ontological division.

The question posed is not whether Judaism failed,
but whether the Jesus event might be reconsidered within the internal logic of Israel’s covenantal narrative.

The inquiry remains open.
