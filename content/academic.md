## 1. Research Purpose and Methodology

This study does not advocate supersessionism nor the revocation of Israel’s covenant.  
Instead, it proposes a reinterpretation of the Jesus event within a **Covenantal Continuity Model**.

Methodologically, the argument proceeds along three interrelated axes:

1. **Biblical-Theological Analysis** — examining the universal trajectory already embedded within the Torah.
2. **Second Temple Jewish Studies** — analyzing the formation of Jewish identity during the late Second Temple period.
3. **Reassessment of Pauline Theology** — interpreting Paul not as a rupture from Judaism, but as a transitional figure within its internal narrative.

The central analytical category of this study is not *rupture*, but **visibility**.

## 2. The Universal Horizon Within the Torah

The motif of “blessing to the nations” in the Abrahamic covenant has long been recognized in modern biblical scholarship as a structurally universal element.

> “All the families of the earth shall be blessed through you.”
> — Genesis 12:3

This universal trajectory is not a later Christian insertion.  
It belongs to the covenantal structure from its inception.

Key scholarly references include:

- **N. T. Wright**, *Paul and the Faithfulness of God*
- **Christopher J. H. Wright**, *The Mission of God*
- **Daniel Boyarin**, *Border Lines*

The universal dimension should therefore be understood not as theological innovation, but as an inherent tension within the covenant itself.

## 3. Paul and the Question of Boundary Formation

Recent scholarship (often associated with the “New Perspective on Paul”) increasingly interprets Paul not as the destroyer of Judaism, but as a figure operating within the internal debates of Second Temple Judaism.

Paul did not abolish Torah.  
Rather, he perceived the moment in which the God of Israel became recognizable within the Gentile world.

This was not departure but inflection.

Paul’s experience can be read as a recognition that the covenant’s universal dimension had entered a new historical visibility.

## 4. The Jewish Background of the Logos Concept

The Logos of the Gospel of John must not be interpreted solely through Hellenistic metaphysics.

Its conceptual roots are deeply connected to Jewish traditions:

- The **Wisdom tradition** of Proverbs 8
- The **Memra** concept in the Targums
- The Logos theology of **Philo of Alexandria**

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
> — John 1:1

Within this framework, the Logos need not imply ontological division.  
It may instead be understood as God’s self-expression — a layer of revelation rather than a second deity.

## 5. Doctrinal Development and Greek Ontological Language

Following the Council of Nicaea (325 CE), terms such as *ousia* (essence) and *hypostasis* (person) were introduced to defend theological claims.

These formulations served an important clarifying function.

Yet philosophical precision can sometimes overshadow the simplicity of the original revelatory event.

This study does not reject doctrinal orthodoxy.  
Rather, it invites renewed attention to Jesus as a covenantal-historical event prior to metaphysical systematization.

---

## 6. Summary Thesis

Jesus is not the founder of a new religion in rupture with Israel.

He may be read as the decisive historical inflection point in which the universal trajectory already embedded within the Torah became visible.

This represents not replacement, but continuity expressed through historical development.

## 7. Human Will, Revelation, and the Conditional Nature of Interpretation

This study does not reduce interpretive disagreement to religious guilt.  
Instead, it proposes a more complex understanding of human will and interpretive formation.

### 7.1 Biblical Framework: Divine Action and Human Agency

The Hebrew Scriptures often describe the same event using parallel language of divine action and human decision.

In Exodus, Pharaoh’s heart is described in layered terms:

- God hardened Pharaoh’s heart (Exod 4:21; 9:12)
- Pharaoh hardened his own heart (Exod 9:34)

This parallelism does not imply fatalism or determinism.  
Rather, it presents human agency as operating within a broader theological horizon.

Scripture preserves human responsibility while simultaneously acknowledging that human will does not function in isolation from divine providence.

### 7.2 Neuroscientific Discussion: The Conditional Formation of Judgment

Modern neuroscience likewise suggests that human judgment is not always a purely isolated act of will.

In 2003, Burns & Swerdlow published a case study in *Archives of Neurology* describing a 40-year-old patient who developed impulse-control abnormalities due to a right orbitofrontal brain tumor.

Following surgical removal of the tumor, the abnormal behavior ceased.  
When the tumor later recurred, the behavioral symptoms returned.

The study indicates that moral judgment and impulse regulation may be influenced by specific neurological conditions.

Furthermore, contemporary research in brain–computer interface (BCI) technologies has advanced beyond merely reading neural signals.  
It increasingly explores the possibility of writing or modulating neural activity through external stimulation.  
Research in this field remains active and rapidly developing.

These developments do not deny human responsibility.  
However, they complicate overly simplistic models of autonomous free will.

### 7.3 Hermeneutical Implications

If human interpretation is formed within overlapping layers — historical memory, collective experience, neurological conditions, and divine providence —

then the reduction of interpretive difference to immediate religious guilt warrants reconsideration.

This is not an argument against accountability.  
It is an appeal for a more nuanced theological anthropology.

Within this framework, covenantal continuity and the limits of human interpretation must be held together rather than opposed.

*This study presupposes the irrevocability of Israel’s covenant and the internal coherence of the Torah, while maintaining an open horizon for theological reflection.*
